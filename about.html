<h2>About</h2>

<p>I am a 19 year old web developer and startup <a href="http://sutterstudios.com">founder</a> living in Oakland, California. You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/robbie">Twitter</a>, hear what I listen to on <a href="http://last.fm/user/robbiet480/">Last.fm</a> or fork my code on <a href="http://github.com/robbiet480">GitHub</a> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:me@robbiet.us">me@robbiet.us</a>.</p>

<h2>This Site</h2>

<p>I purchased robbie.io in 2011 and started it off with <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. Today, it is automatically generated by <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> into a static site. Posts are in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and the source resides on <a href="http://github.com/robbiet480/robbie.io/tree/master">GitHub</a>. Site is marked up with HTML5 and styled with CSS3. All pages should be valid and semantic. This theme is based on both <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com">Tom Preston-Werner</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tatey/tatey.com">Tate Johnson</a>'s work with a little bit of the old Tumblr theme mixed it. If you find an error, <a href="mailto:me@robbiet.us">please let me know</a>.</p>
