  About
</h2>
<p>
  I am a 19 year old web developer and startup <a href="http://sutterstudios.com">founder</a> living in Oakland, California. You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/robbie">Twitter</a>, hear what I listen to on <a href="http://last.fm/user/robbiet480/">Last.fm</a> or fork my code on <a href="http://github.com/robbiet480">GitHub</a>.

  My setup
</h2>
<p>
  I get asked this question quite a bit so here is my current computer setup: I use a 27" Late 2009 Core i7 iMac as my desktop and day-to-day development machine. It is hooked up to a 24 inch Samsung display. My around town machine is a 17" Mid 2009 MacBook Pro, stock configuration. Netbook #1 is a HP Mini 110-1025dx with Mac OS X 10.5.7. Netbook #2 is a Google CR-48 Prototype running Chrome OS and Ubuntu. My current phone is an Apple iPhone 4, 32GB in black. My current tablet is an Apple iPad 1, 32GB, 3G. My tools of choice are Google Chrome, Coda, Textmate and Transmit. I _always_ have a Terminal open on any computer. My servers are hosted at Linode, Hivelocity and SoftLayer.

  This Site
</h2>
<p>
  I purchased {{ site.url }} in 2011 and started it off with <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. Today, it is automatically generated by <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> into a static site. Posts are in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and the source resides on <a href="http://github.com/robbiet480/{{ site.url }}/tree/master">GitHub</a>. Site is marked up with HTML5 and styled with CSS3. The comments are generated by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>. This theme is based on both <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com">Tom Preston-Werner</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tatey/tatey.com">Tate Johnson</a>'s work with a little bit of the old Tumblr theme mixed it. If you find an error, <a href="mailto:me@robbiet.us">please let me know</a>.
